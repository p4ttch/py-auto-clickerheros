# Clicker Heros auto bot script.
Always wanted to make an autoclicking bot for the game Clicker Heros. Which can be found on steam.

# Objective:
- Make a Clicker Heros bot to progress in levels
- Click the monsters 10 times 
- then try move to next level + click for upgrades
- then reset the clicker counter and repeat

### Note: this script is designed for a laptop with screen Size(width=1366, height=768)
- fine coordinates you want to click on by running python and 
```pyautogui.position()  # current mouse x and y
